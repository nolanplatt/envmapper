# envmapper

Created with other AP Computer Science A students. An intuitive solution to environmental issues across the world.

envmapper implements OpenStreetMap, with customized artifacts and themes designed by Nolan Platt.


### My Contributions:

I created the entirety of the map frontend and backend, developed a significant portion of the backend in relation to the blog, authentication etc. I contributed to bootstrap themes, HTML, and JavaScript for the frontend in relation to the map, blog, authentication, and surveys. 


In the original repository (team repository), I was leading in commits, lines added/deleted, and was also the team leader.
