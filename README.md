## PBL Idea
We will be creating a multi-faceted platform that will help the world navigate and solve environmental issues. As Steve Jobs famously said, "Think Different"; our platform will revolutionize how modern citizens navigate issues across Earth. By implementing an interactive map of the globe, users will be able to report environmental issues, while good samaritans can solve them and mark them as complete. 

Potential features include:
- Implemented API of globe map utilizing OpenWorldMap
- Efficient Model View Controller (MVC) to efficiently communicate between frontend/backend and navigate API requests.
- Statistical page (with tangibles) showing how our platform is changing the world (number of tasks reported/completed, number of users, etc).

Mr Hendricks is an AP Biology and AP Environmental Science teacher, and we will be having him as the sponsor to our project. Just like us, this teacher is passionate about preserving the environment and sees the beauty of nature and life and shares interest in making a difference. As our sponsor, he'll help us work towards making a difference, step at a time.
